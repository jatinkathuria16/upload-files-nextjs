# Project Title

A single button dialog that allows you to upload files <=5MB to Vercel's blob storage.
1) Supports multiple uploads
2) Remove uploads
3) Consideration: 5MB === 5 * 1000 * 1000 bytes

Control Flow: 
1. call a third party API (example.com) when the upload begins ✅
2. call a third party (example.com) when the upload succeeds ✅
3. call a third party (example.com) when the upload fails ✅
4. If the file is >5MB please show a modal that rejects ✅
5. After the upload is complete, show a list of links of all uploaded files such that you can download them again.✅
6. Put a pencil icon to each link in the list to rename the file. A modal with Save and Cancel buttons should open for the rename.✅
7. Show a skeleton instead of the list of files when the list is still loading.✅
8. add some fake delay if it loads too fast just to show the effect.✅
10. Put a trash icon next to each link in the list so that you can delete it.✅
